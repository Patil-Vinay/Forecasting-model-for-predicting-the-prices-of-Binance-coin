# Forecasting-model-for-predicting-the-prices-of-Binance-coin
Binance coin is cryptocurrency by Binance. Binance is a cryptocurrency exchange that
provides a platform for trading various cryptocurrencies. It was founded in 2017 and is domiciled in the
Cayman Islands. Binance is currently the largest exchange in the world in terms of the daily trading
volume. Binance was founded by Changpeng Zhao.
In the dataset we can see significant fluctuations of values on regular basis.

As this is a time series forcasting, models which are used for time series forcasting are ARIMA and VARMA. Basically ARIMA stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average, using this model we can predict future prices from past values. In VARMA model, it is done using Grid Search method, this grid search is used to find the best fit parameters for this model. It is important to find these values as it can lead to efficient predictive model.

In this project I learned how to use gradient boosting for time series forcasting. Basically XGBoost helps us to regularize the gradient boosting. The main task of this model is to spped up and increase the performance of the gradient boosted decision tree. 
For this project I have used python as programming language and libraries like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and sklearn.
